MathAche

Creators: Joey, Tyler, Aaron 

Reason: This is a school assignment for Web Development. The main goal of this project was to replicate a basic math forum where you can post questions or thoughts regarding math, and getting valuable feedback from other users.

Functions: This app comes with the ability to create an account. This account has features such as a password which you can reset, a personalized user name, and an age. With these accounts you are able to post on the forum, or comment on other users posts. There is also the option to post images incase you do math problems out on hand and want to show your work. The last major function is a like button which shows how popular the post is.
